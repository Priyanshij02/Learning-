// middlewares:
   client >> app.get ()
 client -- middleware -- app.get()

 so basically client sends rqst to middle ware (mw) , if rqst seems to be valid then only it will forward the rqst ahead 
  else , it will send back response to client 

 - it is a function which runs on every (req,res) 
- it depends that it may forward or not 
- here it uses next keyword in function.
- can be use mw
     app.use(req,res,next)=>{
  }
